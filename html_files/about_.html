        <h2>About Fitness</h2>
        <div class="fitness">
            <p class="text-big">Fitness is the condition of being physically fit and healthy and involves attributes that include,
                but are not limited to mental acuity, cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, body
                composition, and flexibility. While there is a standard definition for fitness, each individual can have their
                own personal understanding of what fitness means. To some individuals, being fit means the ability to complete a
                marathon or  lift a lot of weight.<br><br> To another, it could mean walking around the block without becoming short of
                breath. Your definition of fitness will be influenced by your interests, physical abilities, and goals. No matter
                what the definition, it is important for every individual to keep their personal definition of fitness within
                a healthy framework This means you should have realistic expectations and maintain balance and moderation in
                all aspects of life. Set small , attainable goals and avoid giving too much power to the numerical measurements
                of fitness. This can help your journey to fitness seem much less daunting and much more enjoyable.</p>

    <div class="me">
        <p class="text-small"> I started out by running, setting small goals like 1 mile this week, add a mile next week etc. I then
            saw online there was this mud run race filled with exciting obstacles and immediately was drawn to it. I
            started conditioning my body with more running, interval training and high endurance body weight movements.</p>
        <p>This is where I started to format my hybrid style of training you see today. I completed the mud run successfully and that was the fuel I needed to drive me where I am now.</p>
